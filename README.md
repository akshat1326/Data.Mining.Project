****How to run Code****

There are 2 files in this project
1) Dbscan.ipynb
2) Main.ipynb

Dbscan.ipynb contains the complete code to perform dbscan on a dataset.
The main function in this file is MyDBSCAN,it takes three inputs a dataset files(a list of vectorrs),threshold distance and minimum points in a cluster.

Main.ipynb contains preprocessing, aggregation and plotting of our dataset.
It calls the MyDBSCAN function when required.


****PLOTS****

****IMPORTANT NOTE****

Everywhere in the code and report:
Current Population means number of people residing in that particular area.
Covered Population means number of people having access to water in that area.
